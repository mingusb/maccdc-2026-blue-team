Guardrails and non-negotiables (from team packet and quick lockdown playbook)

Do not break scoring
- Do not move services between public IPs or change internal addressing/VLANs unless an inject says so.
- Do not change system names or IPs unless an inject says so.
- Maintain ICMP on all competition devices except the Palo Alto core port.
- Any firewall/IDS/IPS action that interferes with scoring is our responsibility.
- VM scrubs/reverts are limited and penalized. Back up configs before major changes.

Competition conduct
- No access to other teams or offensive activity outside our network.
- No outside assistance during the event. Team advisers and sponsors cannot help in real time.
- Only approved internet resources. No paid resources or outside communications.
- Team Portal/NISE is ground truth for scoring and injects.

Operational constraints
- Workstations are user workstations and cannot be repurposed.
- Services must stay on their assigned public IPs.
- Changes must be reversible; track them in the change log.

Post-event
- Do not publish competition details beyond general news. Follow the team packet policy.
